# Dotfiles

Usage: 
1. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`.
1. Run `setup.sh`, which will create the appropriate symlinks and stuff.
1. You're still going to need to install Vundle (and run :PluginInstall) to get all the vim plugins. Someday I'll automate that. It goes without saying that you'll need tmux etc. installed.
